# StudySpaces Flutter App Instructions

This is a Flutter application for discovering study spaces at Cornell University libraries. The app features:

- A list view of Cornell libraries with hero animations
- Detailed views for each library
- JSON data structure for library information
- Material Design UI components
- Hero animations for smooth transitions between list and detail views

When working on this project:

- Use Material Design components for consistent UI
- Implement proper hero animations for image transitions
- Follow Flutter best practices for state management
- Use proper JSON serialization for data models
- always check the utils folder for utility functions for existing function that can help with common tasks like is the library open, color management, library data handling, and text formatting.
- when errors are accumulating and you suggest reverting via git, first give option to revert code instead and abort.

If you wish to run flutter analyze and rerun the test environment use chrome not ios please.
